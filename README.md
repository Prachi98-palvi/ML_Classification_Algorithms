# Classification_Algorithms
Shill Bidding Data set was used for learning various Classification ML algorithms.

Shill bidding is when someone bids 
on an item to artificially increase its price, 
desirability, or search standing.

- could create an unfair advantage, or cause another bidder to pay more than they should.
- The data set we have is labelled data set, we can use (Supervised Learning) classification techniques to identify fraudulent shill bidders with - abnormal bidding behaviour or otherwise the normal bidders
